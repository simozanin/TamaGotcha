Use the following commands to keep me alive and happy! :D

f:  Feed me!
s:  Put me to bed... z Z z Z
c:  Clean up my droppings @
v:  Check my vitals!
h:  Ask me for help to show these instructions again!


In order to give me the best life, feed me at least twice a minute,
but not too often or I'll get sick! Feeding me increases my health!
Sleeping also replenishes my health! I need to get some sleep every minute,
and I'll go to sleep on my own if I'm feeling too tired.
While I'm asleep I don't get hungry, and I don't poop!
Oh yeah, about that... I do need to poop sometimes, and you'll need to clean up.
If the place gets too dirty I might start feeling sick...
